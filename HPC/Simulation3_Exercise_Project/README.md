In this course, we were being familiar with MPI, OpenMPI, Parallelization.
Topics:
* Parallelized trapezoidal rule (ex3, ex4)
* Parallelized matrix times vector (ex5)
* Matrix product based on matrix times vector (ex6)
* Fox's algorithm (ex7)
* OpenMP - Avoiding race condition, parallelizing loop (ex8)

We were required to do a porject along with Ex1-Ex8. The project gave me a strong idea about how to use MPI/ OpenMP in real world problem.
